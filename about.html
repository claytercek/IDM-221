      <p>I am a student studying Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University in Philadelphia. The major focuses on elements of design and development for web and app design. While I’m not necessarily fixed on working in that field upon graduation, I do want to be able to speak the language and use the skills I learn as they are becoming increasingly relevant and useful in a progressively digital age.</p>

      <p>I have a great deal of experience working in digital design, working in many areas including 3D, web, graphic, motion graphics, and interactive responsive animation. In my many internships I've helped to design all components of an interactive museum and shopping experience, from the lighting design in a Turrell-esque fog room, to the motion reactive projections that follow people through the exhibit, and even the package design of the products sold.</p>

      <p>I originally got in to digital design via 3D animation early in high school. I started by creating quick 30 second animations in my free time, and usually composed the music to go with too. Since then I’ve self taught a lot more about 3D and the industry.</p>

      <p>For a year and a half, before I started getting too busy with school, I was able to do daily renders, where every day I would post a new image on social media in which I tried to use a new technique to create it. These images ranged from graphic posters for made up concerts, to in depth 3D scenes that I spent the whole day working on. Since I ended the daily project, I’ve still been trying to explore new parts of 3D design with what little free time I have. I’m always learning new software, and I try to put out at least one new video every two months. More recently I’ve been getting into producing videos in stereoscopic 360 for virtual reality.</p>
